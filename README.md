🖋 About Project:

👉 An online banking system built using Python. This system allows the customer and banking staff/manager to manage all transactions easily.

👉 The primary purpose of this system is to simulate customer’s transaction management for Bank to maintain the detail of each transaction/record.

👉 There are 2 users for this system:

1. Admin
   
• Can create new Customer’s profile and provide them login id and password to access the system.

• Can view and search customer profile accordingly.

• Can view all transactions of specific customer.

2. Customer
   
• Can login to the system.

• Can do the transactions like Deposit, Withdrawal.

• Can view their own transactions.

Note: Every user needs to sign in to access the system. All the data must be stored in text (.txt) files.




💻 System Design:

👉 In this online banking system, there are 11 different menus, namely:

• Main Menu

• Admin

• Admin Login

• Admin Menu

• Admin New Profile

• Admin Search Customer Data

• Admin Search Customer Transaction

• Customer

• Customer Login

• Customer Menu

• Customer Deposit

• Customer Withdraw

• Customer View

👉 All the psudeocode for each menu are available here

👉 All the flowchart for each menu are available here

👉 There is also a simple security verification in this system where the customer/admin is asked to enter a password and user id.

👉 Suppose the user id/password is not the same as the database (txt file), the system will ask the user to enter the user id/password again until it is correct.
