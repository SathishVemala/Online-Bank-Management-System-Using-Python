🖋 About Project:
👉 An online banking system built using Python. This system allows the customer and banking staff/manager to manage all transactions easily.
👉 The primary purpose of this system is to simulate customer’s transaction management for Bank to maintain the detail of each transaction/record.

👉 There are 2 users for this system:

Admin
Can create new Customer’s profile and provide them login id and password to access the system.
Can view and search customer profile accordingly.
Can view all transactions of specific customer.
Customer
Can login to the system.
Can do the transactions like Deposit, Withdrawal.
Can view their own transactions.
Note: Every user needs to sign in to access the system. All the data must be stored in text (.txt) files.




💻 System Design:
👉 In this online banking system, there are 11 different menus, namely:

Main Menu
Admin
Admin Login
Admin Menu
Admin New Profile
Admin Search Customer Data
Admin Search Customer Transaction
Customer
Customer Login
Customer Menu
Customer Deposit
Customer Withdraw
Customer View
👉 All the psudeocode for each menu are available here

👉 There is also a simple security verification in this system where the customer/admin is asked to enter a password and user id.
👉 Suppose the user id/password is not the same as the database (txt file), the system will ask the user to enter the user id/password again until it is correct.
